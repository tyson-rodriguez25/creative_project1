            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <img src="../images/thumbnail.jpg" class="aboutme">
            <p> My name is Tyson Rodriguez I am a computer science major at BYU. In my free time I love to play video games and keep
             up with video game news. I started this blog to speak about all things video games. I have loved gaming ever since I was a little kid.
            It has always been my goal to make a video game and sell it. I lover everyting about it and I hope that I can share that love with you.</p>
            <p> Right now, I play mostly on Xbox. My PC is not the best but I play what I can with what I got. I love all types of video games
               fighting, racing, shooters, battle-royales, sport, strategy, RTS, MMOs, etc. I am always willing to play a video game more than once.
               I feel like all video games had time and effort put in so I might as well do the same.</p>
               <p> When I dont play video games, I always find myself doing what others might call "nerd" stuff. I enjoy movies, music,
                  board games, programming, etc. I like to do what I love and life my best life. I'm just trying to vibe, and I hope
                  that others can vibe with me.</p>
                  <p> I hope that I can share with others my love for gaming. I know may people out there are
                    playing games for fun and I hope that I can help those people decide what they want next or
                    point them to the next game they should play. I hope that my opinions and choices
                    help you find out what you want in your gaming expirience.</p>
