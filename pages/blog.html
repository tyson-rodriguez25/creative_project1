                <h4>Nintendo Switch Outsells NES</h4>
                <em>Tyson Rodriguez</em>
                </div>
                <p> The Nintendo switch has officially passed the NES in sales.
                  Which means that it is now Nintendo's third most-popular console, right behind the SNES and the Original Wii.
                  The switch has definetly been one of my favorite consoles in the past decade.
                  This news is exciting news for Nintendo and im excited on more they have to offer.</p>

                      <h4>Outer Worlds for the Switch will not have physical copies</h4>
                      <em>Tyson Rodriguez</em>
                      </div>
                      <p> Outer Worlds, by Obsidian games, is a wonderful game. It is no
                      secret as to why the company will port it over to the Nintendo Switch. However,
                     Outer Worlds for the switch will not have a physical cartridge and will instead have only download codes.
                    I think this is a good idea, however, many consumers wonder why. I think the move to digital games, is a good one.
                    It not only helps the environment, but also shifts to a more digital age.</p>

                            </div>
                            <p> After my first run through of Undertale, I found myself realizing that I am a horrible person.
                             That was when I found out that I can play the game without huting anyone or killing everyone. It depends
                           on how you are feeling in your play through. This game may lack on the graphics and story length, but what you
                         get is something truly special. This is by far one of my favorite games and I cant wait to play it again.  <strong><em>10/10</em></strong></p>

                                  </div>
                                  <p> Mortal Kombat has been one of the most recognized games in the gaming community.
                                  Its plethera of characters with their many movesets balence out nicely, so you are bound to find someone you like.
                                Recently, Netherrealm Studios added Joker, The clown prince of crime from the DC comics onto the roster.
                               Many argue that he was an "unwanted addition". However, many fans love that they are able to see thier favorite villian
                             in all of his M-rated Glory.</p>
